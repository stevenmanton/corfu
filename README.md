Corfu aims to bring the powerful visualization capabilities of the d3.js library to the IPython notebook environment. At the minimum, it abstracts away as much of the boilerplate html needed to create d3 plots in an IPython notebook. However, its primary purpose is to provide a rich pythonic API to d3 visualizations. It is also designed to integrate IPython widgets with d3 visualizations, allowing for extremely flexible interactive visualizations.
